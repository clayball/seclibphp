SecurityReviewPHP
=================

**notice**
In EARLY development. Lots of things are likely to be changing! 


This can be run on the command-line against any PHP codebase to help identify
security flaws that could lead to XSS or SQLi vulnerabilities.

A basic app is included for testing (mostly for testing during development)
