SecurityReviewPHP
=================

**notice**
In EARLY development. Lots of things are likely to be changing! 

My original thought was that this project might be worth doing as a composer
require for a web app and then could be used as part of the deployment
process. However, I'm considering developing this in Python instead.

This can be run on the command-line against any PHP codebase to help identify
security flaws that could lead to XSS or SQLi vulnerabilities.

A basic app is included for testing (mostly for testing during development)
